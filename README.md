Linux control software for PowerUSB USB controlled power strips.

These are inexpensive switched power strips.  Each provides four
outlets.  Three of the outlets are switched, and one is fixed.  The
outlets are controlled and monitored from a computer.

The manufacturer offers control software, but the Linux software
doesn't work the way I would like, so I decided to try writing my own.
